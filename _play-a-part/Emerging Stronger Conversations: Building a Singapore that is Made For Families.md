<p>The “Emerging Stronger Conversations – Building a Singapore that is Made
For Families” was held from April – July 2021. More than 300 individuals
at different life stages shared valuable insights on marriage and parenthood,
and how these may have changed due to COVID-19.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The series of seven online sessions were led by Ms Indranee Rajah, Minister
in the Prime Minister’s Office, and Ms Sun Xueling, Minister of State for
Social and Family Development, and Education, and co-hosted by political
office holders with portfolios relating to various aspects of marriage
and parenthood.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A big thank you to all who participated in the conversations. Check out
