<p>If you are a working mother, you can take 16 weeks of Government-Paid
Maternity Leave to recover from childbirth and bond with your newborn.</p>
<p>The period of leave starts from four weeks before the date of delivery
and should be taken in one stretch. If you and your employer agree, you
can also start your maternity leave anytime within 28 days before delivery,
or no later than the date of your delivery, and the 9th to 16th weeks of
leave can be taken flexibly over a period of 12 months from your child's
date of birth (inclusive of date of birth).</p>
<p>You are eligible for Maternity Leave if you meet all the following criteria:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your child is a Singapore Citizen at birth, or in the case of a stillborn
child, would have been a Singapore Citizen at birth;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employees</strong>: You have worked for your employer for a continuous
period of at least three months before your child is born;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-employed</strong>: You have been engaged in a particular
business, trade, profession or vocation for a continuous period of at least
three months before your child is born, and have lost income because you
did not engage in your business, trade or profession during the Government-Paid
Maternity Leave period.<strong><em><br></em></strong>

<h4><strong>FAQs</strong></h4>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>1. How is child order determined for Government-Paid Maternity Leave?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Child order takes into consideration biological children, adopted-in children
(who are below the age of 12 months at the point of Formal Intent to Adopt),
and stillbirths or children who have passed away (applies to those whose
estimated date of delivery, delivery date, or Formal Intent to Adopt is
on or after 1 November 2021). In the case of biological children, multiple
births (e.g. twins) are considered as one child order.</p>
<p>Stepchildren, foster children and adopted-out children (children adopted-out
before the current childâ€™s estimated date of delivery, delivery date, or
Formal Intent to Adopt) are excluded in the computation of child order.</p>

<summary><strong>2. If my child is not a Singapore citizen at birth but obtains citizenship subsequently, can I qualify for Government-Paid Maternity Leave?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>If your child is not a Singapore citizen at birth, you can still qualify
for the Government-Paid Maternity Leave if he or she obtains Singapore
citizenship within 12 months from his or her date of birth, and if you
meet the other eligibility criteria. The leave can only be consumed after
your child obtains Singapore Citizenship and within 12 months from his
or her date of birth.</p>
