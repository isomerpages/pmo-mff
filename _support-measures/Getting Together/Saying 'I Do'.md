or submit your marriage application to the Registry of Muslim Marriages’
(ROMM) website at <a href="https://www.marriage.gov.sg/muslim/marriage-process" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://www.marriage.gov.sg/muslim/marriage-process</u></a> 
<br><strong>For ROM:</strong> 
<br>The earliest date which you may solemnise your marriage is 21 days after
the date of notice.

is at least 21 days after submitting your marriage application. Your marriage
application will expire 12 months after submission, after which you will
need to submit a new application.

identity documents.
<br>
<br><strong>For ROMM:</strong>
