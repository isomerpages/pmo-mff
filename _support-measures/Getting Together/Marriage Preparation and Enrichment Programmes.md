<p>Congratulations on reaching this milestone! Marriage is a life-long journey
and requires a good foundation, commitment, effort and skills. You and

marriage. Visit <a href="https://go.gov.sg/ffl-mff-marriageprep" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://go.gov.sg/ffl-mff-marriageprep</u></a>&nbsp;to
