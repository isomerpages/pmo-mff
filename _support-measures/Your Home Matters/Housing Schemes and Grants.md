<h4><u>Access to Public Housing</u></h4>
<p><strong>Fiancé / Fiancée Scheme</strong>
<br>In a committed relationship and planning to set up a new home together?
You can apply for a new or resale Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB)
flat even before officially registering your marriage. Click to find out
more about the <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/couples-and-families#Fiancandfiance-1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Fiancé-Fiancée</u></a> Scheme
if you are buying a new flat&nbsp;or resale flat.</p>
<p><strong>Income Ceiling&nbsp;<br></strong>The monthly household income
ceiling to purchase a subsidised flat* is $14,000. For those buying a two-room
flexi flat on a 99-year lease or a three-room flat in selected projects,
your monthly household income ceiling is $7,000. If you wish to buy an
Executive Condominium, the household income ceiling is $16,000.</p>
<p>*A subsidised flat refers to a new flat bought from the HDB, or a resale
flat bought with the CPF Housing
<br>Grant.</p>
<h4><u>First-Timer Privileges</u><br></h4>
<p><strong>Flat Allocation &amp; Ballot Chances</strong>
<br>First-time home-buyers have a better chance of getting a flat. This is
because more flats are set aside for them across mature and non-mature
estates. At least 95 per cent of Build-To-Order (BTO) flats in mature estates
are set aside for first-time families. Starting from the August 2022 BTO
launch, at least 95 per cent of four-room and larger BTO flats and 85 per
cent of three-room BTO flats in non-mature estates are set aside for first-time
families, up from 85 per cent and 70 per cent respectively.
<br>
<br>In addition, first-time home-buyers also get two ballot chances, compared
to one for second-time home-buyers. First-time families who had two unsuccessful
applications for BTO flats in non-mature estates get an additional ballot
for each of their subsequent BTO applications in non-mature estates.</p>
<p><strong>First-time Parents and Married Couples FT(PMC)s</strong>
<br>Eligible first-timer families with a child aged 18 and below, and first-timer
married couples aged 40 and below, will receive greater priority from August
2023. FT(PMC)s will receive an additional ballot for their flat applications
on top of the two ballot chances given to first-timer families.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><u>Priority Schemes</u></h4>
<p><strong>Parenthood Priority Scheme</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Under the Parenthood Priority Scheme (PPS), expectant parents and first-timer
married couples with children have priority when applying for an HDB flat.
HDB sets aside up to 30 per cent of BTO flats and 50 per cent of Sale of
Balance Flats (SBF) for such applicants. From the August 2023 BTO exercise,
PPS will be expanded to include First-Timer (Parents &amp; Married Couples)
(FT(PMC)s) applicants, and will be renamed as the Family and Parenthood
Priority Scheme (FPPS). This means that young married couples who do not
yet have children can also receive priority under FPPS if they qualify
as FT(PMC). Up to 40 per cent of BTO flats and up to 60 per cent of SBF
flats will be set aside for the FPPS.</p>
<p><strong>Married Child Priority Scheme<br></strong>If you are applying
for a flat to live with or near your parents, you can consider the Married
Child Priority Scheme. Up to 30 per cent of BTO flats/SBF units (for first-timers)
and up to 5 per cent of BTO flats/up to 3 per cent of SBF units (for second-timers)
are set aside for eligible applicants. Parents who wish to live near or
with their married child can also apply for flats under this priority scheme
within eligible areas.&nbsp;
<br>
<br><strong>Third Child Priority Scheme<br></strong>Larger families, such
as those with at least three children, are eligible for this scheme. Up
to 5 per cent of BTO flats/SBF units have been set aside to accommodate
larger households.

<h4><u>Housing Grants</u></h4>
<p><strong>For New HDB Flats<br></strong>New flats such as BTO flats are
generously subsidised. In addition, first-timer couples buying a new flat
(excluding ECs) can apply for the <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/couples-and-families/enhanced-cpf-housing-grant-families" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Enhanced CPF Housing Grant</u></a>&nbsp;of
up to $80,000 for any flat type and in any estate. Families with lower
household incomes will receive a larger grant amount. You can apply for
the grant if your combined monthly income is $9,000 or less. The grant
amount is tiered, depending on the average gross monthly household income
for the 12 months prior to the flat application.</p>
<p><strong>[Enhanced] For Resale HDB Flats<br></strong>First-timer couples
buying a resale HDB flat can receive housing grants of up to $190,000,
comprising the <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/couples-and-families/cpf-housing-grants-for-resale-flats-families" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>CPF Housing Grant for Resale Flats (Families)</u></a>&nbsp;of
up to $80,000, <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/couples-and-families/enhanced-cpf-housing-grant-families" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Enhanced CPF Housing Grant</u></a> of
up to $80,000 and <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/couples-and-families/proximity-housing-grant-families" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Proximity Housing Grant</u></a> of
up to $30,000.
<br>
<br>Similar to buyers of new flats, you can also apply for the <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/couples-and-families/enhanced-cpf-housing-grant-families" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Enhanced CPF Housing Grant</u></a> of
up to $80,000 if you have a combined income of $9,000 or less. This grant
is tiered based on income, so families with lower household incomes will
receive a larger grant amount, and families will receive a pro-rated amount
if the remaining lease on the flat cannot cover the youngest buyer/spouse
till the age of 95.</p>
<p>If you are a first-timer couple with a combined monthly household income
of $14,000 or less, you can apply for the CPF Housing Grant for Resale
Flats (Families) of up to $80,000 for four-room or smaller resale flats,
and $50,000 for five-room or larger resale flats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, you may receive a Proximity Housing Grant of $20,000 if you
buy a resale flat to live near (i.e. within 4km) your parents or child,
or $30,000 if you buy a resale flat to live with your parents or child.</p>
<h4><u>Flexibility for Young Couples</u></h4>
<p><strong>Deferment of Income Assessment for Housing Grants and Loan<br></strong>First-timer
couples who (a) are full-time students or in full-time National Service,
or (b) have recently completed their studies or National Service and are
planning for marriage, can apply for a flat first. You can defer your income
assessment for housing grants and loan till nearer to your key collection
appointment.&nbsp;
<br>
<br><strong>Staggered Downpayment Scheme<br></strong>The <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/sign-agreement-for-lease?anchor=sds" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Staggered Downpayment Scheme</u></a> lets
you pay your HDB downpayment in two instalments. If at least one applicant
is aged 30 years or younger at the point of application, as a first-timer
couple, you can just pay the downpayment in two stages – 5 per cent when
you sign the Agreement for Lease, and the remainder upon taking possession
of your new flat.
<br>
<br><strong>Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme<br></strong>The <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/renting-a-flat/renting-from-hdb/parenthood-provisional-housing-schemepphs" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme</u></a> is
an additional interim housing option for eligible citizen families waiting
for their new flats to be completed. Families may qualify if they have
booked an uncompleted flat under the HDB Sales Exercise, and have a monthly
household income of $7,000 or below.
