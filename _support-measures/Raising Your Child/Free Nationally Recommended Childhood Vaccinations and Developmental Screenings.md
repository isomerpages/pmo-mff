<p>The National Childhood Immunisation Schedule lists childhood vaccinations
recommended for protection against common vaccine-preventable diseases
in Singapore. Developmental screenings conducted at specific age touchpoints
are part of preventive care for all children, and aim to identify children
at risk of developmental delay for early interventions.</p>
<p>Childhood vaccinations recommended under the National Childhood Immunisation
Schedule and childhood developmental screenings are fully subsidised for
eligible Singaporean children at all polyclinics and Community Health Assist
Scheme General Practitioner clinics. For more information on the National
Childhood Immunisation Schedule and childhood developmental screening,
