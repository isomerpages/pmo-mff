<p><strong>Protection from birth</strong>
<br>MediShield Life is a basic health insurance that helps to pay for large
hospital bills and selected costly outpatient treatments, like dialysis
and chemotherapy for cancer. It is sized for subsidised treatments in public
hospitals. If you choose to receive unsubsidised care in public hospitals
or in a private hospital, you are still covered by MediShield Life but
the payout will cover a smaller proportion of your bill. Starting from
birth, all Singapore Citizen babies, including those with congenital and
neonatal conditions, are automatically covered for life by MediShield Life.</p>
<p><strong>Payment for MediShield Life Premiums</strong>
<br>MediShield Life premiums may be fully paid from MediSave. Parents can
tap on the <a href="https://www.madeforfamilies.gov.sg/support-measures/raising-your-child/healthcare/medisave-life-coverage-for-newborns" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>MediSave Grant for Newborns</u></a>&nbsp;to
pay for their childrenâ€™s MediShield Life premiums. Premium Subsidies are
provided to the lower- to middle-income. If you require further support
to pay for MediShield Life premiums even after Government subsidies, MediSave
use and have limited family support, you can apply for Additional Premium
Support. No one will lose MediShield Life coverage due to an inability
to pay.</p>
