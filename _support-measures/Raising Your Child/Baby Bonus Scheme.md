<p><strong>Baby Bonus Scheme</strong>
<br><strong>[Enhanced: For eligible children born on or after 14 February 2023] </strong>The
Baby Bonus Scheme helps you manage the costs of raising a child. It comprises
the Baby Bonus Cash Gift (BBCG) and a Child Development Account (CDA) –
a special co-savings scheme for your child. The CDA has two components
–&nbsp; the First Step Grant, and Government co-matching of parents’ savings.
The Baby Bonus Scheme has been enhanced for eligible children born on or
after 14 February 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Baby Bonus Cash Gift</strong>
<br>The Government has increased the BBCG by $3,000 for children in all birth
orders, and adjusted the payout schedule to provide financial support on
a regular basis, once every six months till the child turns six-and-a-half
years. This way, parents can receive sustained support all the way till
their child enters primary school.<strong><br><br>Your child is eligible for the Baby Bonus Cash Gift if: </strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>He or she is a Singapore Citizen; and</p>

<p><em>*The figures in bold reflect post-enhancement amounts, with changes from current quantum indicated in parentheses. Note: Children born from 14 February 2023 would have received the first disbursement of their BBCG at birth.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Child Development Account</strong>
<br>The Child Development Account (CDA) is a special savings account for your
child. The First Step Grant is deposited into the CDA without you having
to save first, and your subsequent savings will be co-matched by the Government,
up to a cap.</p>
<p><strong><em>Child Development Account First Step Grant</em><br></strong>The
Government has enhanced the CDA by increasing the CDA First Step Grant
by $2,000 (from $3,000 to $5,000) for children in all birth orders. The
CDA First Step Grant will be automatically deposited when you open the
CDA for your child at any of the following banks: DBS/POSB, OCBC or UOB.</p>
<p><strong><em>Government co-matching of parents’ savings<br></em></strong>Enjoy
dollar-for-dollar matching from the Government when you save into your
child’s CDA, up to the Government co-matching cap. The Government has increased
the co-matching cap by $1,000 for children in the first and second birth
orders.</p>
<p>You can save into and use the CDA at any time before 31 December of the
year your child turns 12 years old. The savings in the account can be used
for:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Fees for registered childcare centres, kindergartens, special education
schools and early intervention programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medical expenses at healthcare institutions such as hospitals and General
Practitioner clinics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Premiums for MediShield Life or MediSave-approved private integrated plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assistive technology devices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eye-related products and services at optical shops</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approved healthcare items at pharmacies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://www.babybonus-eservices.msf.gov.sg/ai-home/xhtml/layout/ListOfAI.faces" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Ministry of Social and Family Development’s Approved Institution webpage</u></a> for
the full list of organisations where the CDA savings can be used at.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any savings left in the CDA after the year your child turns 12 will be
transferred to his or her Post-Secondary Education Account*. Parents who
have not saved up to the co-matching cap can continue to contribute to
the Post-Secondary Education Account and receive the matching amount until
the cap is reached, or when the child turns 18 years old, whichever is
earlier.</p>
<p><em>*The Post-Secondary Education Account helps parents save for their children’s post-secondary education needs. Funds in the account can be used to pay for approved programmes (e.g. diploma, undergraduate programmes) in approved institutions, as well as to repay Government education loans and financial schemes. Subject to a cap, comprising the sum of the applicable CDA Government co-matching cap (based on the child’s birth order), the equivalent deposits made by parents, any ad-hoc top-ups to the CDA made by the Government, and accrued interests.</em>

<br><em>Note:&nbsp;Starting from 1 Aug 2023, all eligible children enrolled in the Baby Bonus scheme will receive the higher CDA pay-outs (CDA First Step Grant, CDA Government co-matching cap) under the enhanced Baby Bonus Scheme.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
