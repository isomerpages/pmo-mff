<br>Infant care services cater to infants aged between two and 18 months.
They are usually provided in childcare centres, though some centres only
provide either infant or childcare services.
<br>Childcare centres provide early childhood care and development programmes
for children aged between 18 months and below seven years old.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kindergartens
<br>Kindergartens provide preschool education programmes for children between
18 months and below seven years old. Most kindergarten sessions are three
to four hours each day.
<br>MOE Kindergartens (MKs) offers are sited within primary schools and offer
four-hour K1 and K2 programmes for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents
aged 5 and 6. For parents who require full-day services for their child,
Kindergarten Care (KCare) is available at all MKs. Click to find out more

<p><strong>MOE Kindergarten – Early Years Centre Partnership</strong> 
<br>MOE partners two Anchor Operators&nbsp;– PCF Sparkletots&nbsp;and NTUC
First Campus My First Skool&nbsp;– to provide a continuum of&nbsp;quality
and affordable preschool education for children aged two months to six
years via the MOE Kindergarten - Early Years Centre (MK-EYC) Partnership.</p>
<p>Under the MK-EYC model, your child will attend an EYC until he or she
is four years old. PCF and NFC provide preschool services for children
aged two months to four years. Eligible children in the EYCs are guaranteed
a place at a partner MK and can choose to enrol at the MK to continue their
K1 and K2 programme, ensuring a seamless transition to K1 in the year they
turn five.</p>
