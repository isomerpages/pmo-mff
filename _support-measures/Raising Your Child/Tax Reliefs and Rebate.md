per child for your third and subsequent child. The child must be a Singapore
Citizen at the time of birth or within 12 months thereafter.</p>
<p>You may share the Parenthood Tax Rebate with your spouse for each qualifying

Tax Rebate can be used to offset your income tax payable in subsequent
years until the tax rebate is fully utilised.</p>

Relief, or $7,500 per child under the Handicapped Child Relief.</p>
