<h2><strong>Waiver of Passport Application Fee for Newborns</strong></h2>
<p>Since 1 January 2020, the passport application fee has been waived for
Singaporean children’s first passport, provided the application is made
before the child’s first birthday. There are two ways to check if your
child is eligible for the passport application fee waiver.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Log in to <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>MyICA</u></a> using
your Singpass. You will receive an electronic notification in the “Notifications”
box on your personal dashboard if your child is eligible. Click on the
notification, which will direct you to a webpage to apply for your child’s
passport, without having to pay the application fee.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Alternatively, you can log on to<a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/documents/passport/apply" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u> ICA’s passport e-Service</u></a>.
Click on “Apply Online”, select “Apply for Passport (On behalf of others)”
and enter your child’s IC number. You will receive a pop-up informing you
if your child is eligible for the passport application fee waiver. Click
“Proceed” to apply for your child’s passport, without having to pay the
application fee.</p>
