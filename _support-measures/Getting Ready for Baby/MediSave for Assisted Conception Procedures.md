<p>&nbsp;Conceiving may not always be easy, especially at an older age. Those
who face fertility challenges may wish to seek help via Assisted Conception
Procedures such as Assisted Reproduction Technology treatments.
<br>
<br>You can tap on your MediSave to help you with the costs of treatments
such as in-vitro fertilisation and Intra-Uterine Insemination at both private
and public Assisted Reproduction centres.</p>
<p>You may withdraw $6,000 for the first treatment cycle, $5,000 for the
second cycle and $4,000 for the third and subsequent cycles from your spouseâ€™s
or your MediSave account. The same MediSave withdrawal limits apply per
patient, regardless of whether you are a Singapore Citizen or Permanent
Resident. The total MediSave withdrawal across cycles allowed for Assisted
Conception Procedures is $15,000.</p>
<p>The success rate of Assisted Conception Procedures falls with age, so
try not to delay childbearing.</p>
