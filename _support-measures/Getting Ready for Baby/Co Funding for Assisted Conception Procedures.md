the Government. The co-funding will cover:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Intra-Uterine Insemination procedure, for a maximum of three cycles;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assisted Reproduction Technology treatment, up to three fresh and three
frozen Assisted Reproduction Technology cycles</p>
</li>

<p>Co-funding for Assisted Reproduction Technology covers procedures such
as in-vitro fertilisation and its variations (with or without intracytoplasmic
sperm injection, in-vitro maturation, donor cycles and double stimulation
cycles), as well as gamete intra-fallopian transfer. Co-funding can be
considered for all standard procedures, ranging from ovarian stimulation
or thawing of the embryo, to embryo transfer. The co-funding&nbsp;does
not cover initial consultations and investigations prior to your decision
to start the treatment.</p>
<p>You are eligible for Assisted Conception Procedures co-funding if you
meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>For Assisted Reproduction Technology co-funding:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You are below 40 years of age at the start of the cycle (except for the
last two cycles for couples where the wife had previously attempted an
Assisted Reproduction Technology/Intra-Uterine Insemination procedure before
age 40);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have not already received three co-funded fresh and three co-funded
frozen cycles in the past;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have been assessed by a doctor to have met the clinical requirements
for Assisted Reproduction Technology ^; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You or your spouse must be a Singapore Citizen at the start of the Assisted
Reproduction Technology cycle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>^Investigations and tests are required to determine if a couple meets the clinical criteria to undergo Assisted Reproduction Technology treatment. This process may take up to three months before a couple can commence their cycle.<br><br></em>For
Intra-Uterine Insemination co-funding:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You are below 40 years of age at the start of the cycle;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have been assessed by a doctor to be suitable to try Intra-Uterine
Insemination; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You or your spouse must be a Singaporean Citizen at the start of the Intra-Uterine
Insemination cycle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Couples with at least one Singaporean spouse who is clinically eligible
for Pre-implantation Genetic Testing for Monogenic/Single Gene Defects
(PGT-M) and Chromosomal Structural Rearrangements (PGT-SR) can receive
up to 75% in government co-funding, capped at the maximum claimable amount
for each PGT-M and PGT-SR stage, and tap on their own or their spouse's
MediSave.

<h4><strong>FAQs</strong></h4>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>1. Which Assisted Reproduction centres are eligible for the Assisted Conception Procedures co-funding scheme?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Assisted Reproduction Technology and Intra-Uterine Insemination co-funding&nbsp;are&nbsp;available
only at Assisted Reproduction centres in Singapore public hospitals. They
are located at National University Hospital, Singapore General Hospital,
and KK Women's and Children's Hospital.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>2. Is Assisted Reproduction Technology/Intra-Uterine Insemination co-funding extended to private hospitals?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>No. Similar to general healthcare subsidies, the co-funding scheme only
applies to treatment done at public hospitals. Patients can still withdraw
from their MediSave to pay for the treatment performed at private hospitals,
up to the prevailing withdrawal limits.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>3. Do I have to apply for the Assisted Conception Procedures co-funding scheme for my Assisted Reproduction Technology/Intra-Uterine Insemination treatments?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>You do not need to apply for the co-funding scheme. Simply fill up a declaration
form provided by the hospital, which will be used to check your eligibility
for the scheme. The hospital will incorporate the co-funding into your
bill once it verifies that you are eligible.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>4. Can I use MediSave to foot the remaining costs of a co-funded Assisted Conception Procedures cycle?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Yes, MediSave can be used to pay for co-funded cycles and cycles that
are not co-funded. You can withdraw the following amounts from either your
spouse’s or your MediSave account, up to a lifetime withdrawal limit of
$15,000:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>First cycle: up to $6,000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second cycle: up to $5,000</p>

<li>
<p>Third and subsequent cycles: up to $4,000 per cycle</p>

<summary><strong>5. I have two children and am trying for a third child. Will I still qualify for the Assisted Conception Procedures co-funding scheme?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Yes, you will qualify for the co-funding if you meet all the criteria.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>6. Why is there an age restriction for the Assisted Conception Procedures co-funding scheme?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Assisted Conception Procedures co-funding scheme is meant to encourage
couples who have difficulty conceiving to seek treatment early, as medical
evidence shows that the chance of conception is significantly higher for
a woman who undergoes Assisted Reproduction Technology/ Intra-Uterine Insemination
treatment at a younger age.&nbsp;Based on our studies, success rates* are
26.6 per cent for women below 30, 24.6 per cent for women from 30 to 34,
17.1 per cent for women from 35 to 39, and 6.7 per cent for women 40 and
above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imposing an age criterion of 40 years old for the Assisted Conception
Procedures co-funding scheme hence seeks to strike a balance between the
clinical evidence on reduced efficacy with increase in maternal age, while
supporting some couples who may be unable to receive Assisted Conception
Procedures early.</p>
<p>As a concession to support some couples who may wish to try to conceive
even beyond 40 years of age, the Ministry of Health has also extended co-funding
for up to two unutilised Assisted Reproduction Technology cycles (out of
the six Government co-funded Assisted Reproduction Technology cycles) to
women beyond age 40, as long as they have attempted an Assisted Conception
Procedure before age 40.</p>
<p>Intra-Uterine Insemination co-funding is not extended to women aged 40
or beyond, because their doctors are likely to recommend that they undergo
Assisted Reproduction Technology treatments,&nbsp; as clinical evidence
has shown that their chances of conceiving are very low.</p>
<p>In general, as the success rate of Assisted Conception Procedures falls
with age, try not to delay childbearing.</p>
<p>*Based on average Assisted Reproduction Technology success rates by patient’s
age group from 2014 to 2018.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>7. Why is co-funding only provided for three fresh and three frozen Assisted Reproduction Technology cycles? What about subsequent cycles for couples who may need it?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The number of co-funded cycles is based on existing clinical evidence
that the success rate of Assisted Reproduction Technology decreases with
each&nbsp;additional cycle and age. Co-funding for three fresh and three
frozen cycles allows couples to freeze and store excess embryos produced
from fresh cycles, and to follow up with a frozen treatment cycle subsequently
if required.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>8. Why is co-funding only provided for three Intra-Uterine Insemination cycles? What about subsequent cycles for couples who may need it?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The number of co-funded cycles is set based on the typical clinical practice
where couples usually try three cycles of Intra-Uterine Insemination before
moving on to Assisted Reproduction Technology.
