<summary><strong>1. What is the average pre-delivery and delivery expenses for a Singaporean couple? On average, how much will the MediSave Maternity Package reduce a Singaporean coupleâ€™s out-of-pocket costs?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Expenses can vary and depend on the type of hospital care, subsidies available
and delivery procedure required.</p>
<p>
<br>A Singaporean couple can also receive up to 80 per cent means-tested subsidies
for their delivery episode in a subsidised ward, and up to 70 per cent
means-tested subsidies for specialist outpatient care that may be required.
After subsidies and MediSave, the average Singaporean couple can expect
close to zero out-of-pocket payments for their pre-delivery and delivery
expenses.</p>
<p>Couples that face difficulty affording their subsidised pre-delivery and
delivery expenses after MediSave usage can approach medical social workers
at public hospitals for financial assistance.</p>
