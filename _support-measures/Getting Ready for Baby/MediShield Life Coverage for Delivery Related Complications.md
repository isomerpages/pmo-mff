<p>&nbsp;MediShield Life is a basic health insurance that helps you pay for
large hospital bills and selected costly outpatient treatments, like dialysis
and chemotherapy for cancer.&nbsp;It is sized for subsidised treatments
in public hospitals. If you choose to receive unsubsidised care in public
hospitals or in a private hospital, you are still covered by MediShield
Life but the payout will cover a smaller proportion of your bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scheme provides assurance for mothers who encounter serious complications
such as eclampsia, cervical incompetency and postpartum haemorrhage during
their pregnancies and delivery episodes. It covers inpatient treatments
for such complications under the prevailing inpatient claim limits. You
can find the list of serious complications covered by MediShield Life
