<p>Centre for Fathering is a non-profit organisation founded in 2000 to promote
active and involved fathering and address issues caused by fatherlessness
in Singapore. The organisation aims to turn the hearts of children towards
their fathers by empowering more fathers to be better role models and an
enduring inspiration to their children.

<br>DADs for Life seeks to inspire and mobilise fathers to become more involved
with their families and children, and be a good influence to them… for
life. Under the DADs for Life umbrella are initiatives such as Back to
School with DAD, Eat With Your Family Day and Celebrating Fathers. These
initiatives encourage fathers to spend time with their families and create
a culture that promotes active fathering.

<p>I Love Children (ILC) is a voluntary welfare organisation set up in 2005.
It advocates a higher priority to having children and educating couples
on fertility wellness.</p>
<p>ILC has been spearheading the annual fertility campaigns since 2016, partnering
like-minded individuals and partners, to provide support for couples with
fertility challenges. ILC also started a localised fertility peer support
group in 2019, for couples who are trying to conceive. ILC will continue
to drive awareness of fertility health and encourage more couples to plan
earlier for a family.</p>

<p>MUMs for Life is a ground-up movement which celebrates a mum’s unique
identity as a woman and her irreplaceable roles as a daughter, wife and
mother. When Mums are confident in their unique identity and multiple roles,
they can better nurture our children and support Dads in building a stronger
family in an increasingly complex world.
