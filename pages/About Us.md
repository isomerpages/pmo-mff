<h2><strong>Singapore is Made For Families.</strong></h2>
<p>Families are the backbone of our society. We stand together with Singaporeans
as they start and raise their families.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The Made For Families initiative was launched by the National Population
and Talent Division in the Strategy Group, Prime Minister’s Office, to
assure families in Singapore of support from the government and community
at large.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Made For Families brand mark represents the different ways – big and small
– in which Singapore supports families. Companies, organisations and community
groups can adopt this brand mark to identify themselves as championing
family values in our society. Government programmes that help couples marry,
start and raise their families will also be identified as reason why Singapore
is Made For Families.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Supporting Singaporeans in fulfilling their plans to get married and raise
families is a key national priority. While the Government's Marriage and
Parenthood package has been enhanced progressively to address evolving
needs of Singaporeans, everyone can play their part too. Together, we can
build a society that is Made For Families through strong foundational support
such as family-friendly spaces and workplaces, products and services, and
family-bonding activities.</p>
